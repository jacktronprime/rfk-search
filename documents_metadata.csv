Oh God! how sad she is! Mother Kennedy,

No Mother will ever bear the grief so bloody.
Oh Lord! we pray Thee, make her bold,

To mourn the loss of sons worth gold.

Sons who strived for sure Bemocracy, by pure ballots,
Proud mother she is; though they fell to bullets.

Oh Criminals! why you grew in your mothers! wombs?
Violence makes her sons less; and three their tombs.

Her heart loaded with grief thinks no revenge,

Like a Mother~hen who lost three under her wings.

Sons stood for freedom, like Lincoln forever remind;
Bereaved; never mind! under the grave Freedom will ring.

Heroes they are; her young ones so dear,

Pistols felled them one by one, how to bear?

Oh Father Jesus! - you carried the cross for sinners,

So Rose; May Mother forgive? Heartless brutes are killers

And now death takes him

Such chance lost to serve the people

The nation mourn

The world in sorrow

For so much he could do

In bettering peace for all

A good man gone

No chance redeen

For he could lead mankind
Where love and trust are known

For hope we own

A new jeader comes

And peace on earth shall be
But his name be in history.

As promised in the referenced airgram, the Mlbassy transmits the
lJsc-i-
book of condolences which was open for signature following the assassina
;/,
tion of Senator Robert F. Kennedy. The book contains the signatures of
Prime Minister Hoveyda and five other Cabinet Ministers, most of the senior
officials of the Ministry of Forei{?Tl Affairs, virtually all the foreign
Ambassadors and Charges resident in Tehran, persons from all walks of
Iranian life, and persons from the American official, business, and tran
sient tourist communities. Informal translations have been made of inscrip
tions written in the Persian language.
The Embassy also forwards the letters of sympathy addressed to the
Ambassador, along with the acknowledgements of the Charge d'Affaires. It
was thought that the Department might wish to forward the book and the
C\l letters to the Kennedy family.

Friend,

In addressing your conscience We shall pot resort to exuygeration, We shall only place before vou
essential facts relating to the case of a voung man Who is being tried in vour country, Amcrica, namely
Sivhan Bishara Sirhan.

ot

We are confident, while this case is being discussed by the American court, that law will prevail in
the end. We agree that crime cannot solve the problems of the individual or of the community.

But the young man in question was deliberately uprooted from his homeland to face an unknown
destiny which finally led him to your country while still a child. However, he was not a happy child as
his memory was filled with the atrocious massacres committed by alien people in his country and against
his people. You certainly agree with us that the case of a young man with such painful reminiscences of
an unhappy childhood, should be treated within the framework of his people's cause.

We are aware that you must have known a lot about the cause of Palestine, the homeland of this
young man. But we regret that, most probably, what you have known is widely different from the truth.

We also realise that the charge levelled at this map has created a delicate situation as regards
U.S. relations with the Palestine problem raising many questions about the consequences of this incident
to American and world public opinion.

The defendant, Sirhan Bishara Sirhan was born in Palestine and his family was a victim of the
Israeli usurpatior of this Arab country as a result of wach it immigrated to America. The incident was
committed one year after the aggression of June 5th., 1967. This timing underlines the importance of
political considerations which cannot be easily overlooked.

This young man standing before the court, moves the cunscience of the world with his bitter ques-
tion «where is my homeland ? Where is my people ? And where is my house ?» The answer is. «J no
louger have a country or a place which I can call mine. I am sick of living in a foreign country. ] want
a place whose inhabitants speak my language and ent the fuod T like... T want my city, Jerusalem, mv
land Palestine and my job there. »

These words echo the feelings of many other emigrants who ask the same question. All that they
want from you and your people is, understanding. Nothing can be more painful for a valiant people strug-
gling for their rights than to find these rights wasted through deceit and facts distorted and mtsre-
presented.

Robert F. Kennedy and Sirhan Bishara Sirhan are both victims of intertwined factors. We hope,
friend, that you would realise this fact and draw the attention of your great people to it.

With best wishes for friendly ties and understanding between our two peoples.

Yours Sincerely.

and Tom Braden article entitled ""Rogers Backed but Judge
Rejected Sirhan Guilty Plea for Life Term.'' Following are
some of pertinent quotations from article.

2. ""The State Department specifically approved an agreement
reached here last week by which Sirhan Sirhan would change
his plea to ‘guilty’ in exchange for a sentence of life
imprisonment .""

3. ""Los Angeles District Attorney Evelle Younger advised
Secretary RSEKXKXYXKEXWMK of State William P. Rogers in
Washington of these possibilities in the bargaining between
his office and the Sirhan defense staff and received approval
from Rogers for the plan."" ,

SUBJECT: Sirhan Trial

1. In reply query Jordanian Ambassador Sharaf has informed

gp

Dept that to best his knowledge GOJ does not rpt not plan
send special reps or one of Embassy officers to observe
Sirhan trial due beginning Jan 7 at Los Angeles. Sharaf
stated Jordanian representation will be handled by Honorary
Consul George Zureiqat (US citizen), who will be available
observe certain sessions as necessary. He thought it unlikely
Zureiqat plans sit through entire proceeding.

2. Recalling reports several months ago that head Jordanian
Bar Association might attend trial, Dept would appreciate
Embassy discreetly confirming that GOJ has decided not send
official observer.

3. Please advise also if XX¥N¥% you aware any private Arab
lawyers who may be planning attend trial in unofficial capacity.

iN letter (Enclosure No. 1), dated August 21, from the Chief of Police of the

Director General of Jordan's Public Security Forces a request for informa-
e) 1 | tion concerning events which took place in the areas of the known residences
i of the Sirhan Family in the 190-1957 period, during the time of their
residence in each area. The purpose of the inquiry was to obtain informa-
tion for use in connection with a possible defense in the Sirhan trial
based on the theory of a diminished capacity of the accused to form intent
caused by accumulated traumatic experiences during his childhood.

The Embassy's interim reply (Enclosure No. 2), dated August 31, informed
the Los Angeles Police Department that the area of the Sirhan family's
former residences was now under Israeli control and that an inquiry
addressed to the Jordanian authorities would not, in the Embassy's opinion,
prove productive. The Embassy proposed, as an initial alternative, to
gather what information it could through discreet inquiry and forward it
to Los Angeles.

A memorandum with appended map of Jerusalem (Enclosure No. 3) sets
forth the results of the Embassy's preliminary inquiry which included
several books, personal knowledge of officers at the American Embassy
in Amman and the American Consulate in Jerusalem, and conversations
with local employees from the Jerusalem area. Conversations with other
than official Americans were restricted to discussion of events without
reference to the Sirhan case. Any effort on the part of the Embassy to
relate the events described to particular members of the Sirhan family
would have required direct questioning of persons acquainted with the
family and living in the specific area at the time. A detailed inquiry
of this nature would necessitate a considerable expenditure of time
and effort by Embassy personnel as well as bringing Jordanian, and
perhaps Israeli authorities into the matter, all of which the Embassy
would be reluctant to do in the light of present tensions in the area,

The memorandum and map are forwarded to SCS for review and transmittal
to the City of Los Angeles Police Department.

Ref. No. 6.24

August 21, 1968

The Honorable Harrison M. Symmes
The United States Ambassador
United States Embassy

Amman, Jordan

This department is conducting a thorough investigation of the assassination
of Senator Robert F. Kennedy on June 5, 1968, at the Ambassador Hotel,
Los Angeles, California.

A very important phase of the investigation is a complete background coverage
of the suspect, Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, from the date of his birth to the

date of the assassination. Considerable documented background information
has been gathered on the Sirhan family. The recent plea of ""Not Guilty"" by
Sirhan indicates a possible defense based on the theory of a diminished
capacity to form intent which was caused by accumulated traumatic experiences.
This necessitates a history of said experiences for study and evaluation

by the psychiatrist assigned to the prosecution.

The Sirhan family has alleged that as a child the accused was exposed to
many bombings, strafings and possible death in the streets while living in
New and Old Jerusalem. Our historical research indicates that many bombings
and strafings occurred in the Jerusalem, Palestine area from 194 through
1948. There is further indication that there were occasional incidents of
that nature from 1948 through 1957 in Jerusalem, Jordan. In view of the
above it is imperative to the medical rebuttal that it be determined if
Sirhan, in fact, actually experienced such incidents.

Immigration data, known former residences of the Sirhan family and a list
of questions are enclosed. Pursuant to advice received from Mr. Byron Engle,

Director,

August 31, 1968

Dear Chief Reddin:

I have your letter of August 21, Ref. No. 6.2), regarding
Sirhan Bishara Sirhan and certain background information you
seek concerning areas in which he reportedly lived.

As the area of what was formerly Palestine in which Sirhan
resided is now under Israeli control and Jordanian authorities
do not have access to all of their records on the West Bank, we
do not believe it would be too productive to ask the Jordanian
security authorities to try to compile the information you have
requested. We propose, therefore, initially to seek to answer
your questions as completely as we can, both through our own
knowledge and through discreet inquiry by Embassy personnel.

We are also exploring the subject through the Consul General in
Jerusalem. We will further consider the prospects of obtaining
from the Government of Jordan a statement on events in the areas
concerned; however, we would appreciate your views on the use-
fulness of material developed entirely by the Embassy.

We hope to forward a report to you within the next ten
days. This, therefore, should be considered an interim reply.

Sincerely,

Harrison M. Symmes

MEMORANDUNHN

This memorandum describes events which took place in the area of the known
residence of the Sirhan Family during the period of their residence. Sources
include several books recording events of the time, personal knowledge of
officers of the American Consulate in Jerusalem and the American Embassy at
Amman, and conversations with natives of Jerusalem. A map of Jerusalen,
printed in 1952, is attached.

Much has been written on Jerusalem during the 198 Arab-Israeli War,
particulaPly from the Jewish side. The following references are suggested:

1940-1942 El Qatamon, Jerusalem, Palestine

El Qatamon, or Katamon, is a residential district on the southwestern out-
skirts of Jerusalem which, prior to the 1948 Arab-Israel war, was largely
inhabited by upper-middle class Christian Arabs. 190-1942 was a period of
prosperity in El Qatamon, during which no fighting or disturbances on a
significant scale are known to have taken place.

1943-194 Beit Safafa, Jerusalem, Palestine

Beit Safafa is an Arab village on the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv rail line, situated
to the southwest of Jerusalem about one mile beyond El Qatamon. Although in
1944 fighting did break out against the British in some parts of Palestine,
to the best of our knowledge no fighting occurred in Beit Safafa in the
1943-194) period.

1944-1946 Tabah (off Ramallah Road), Jerusalem, Palestine

Tabah may be either Tibeh or Taibeh, birthplace and current residence of

the father of Sirhan Bishara Sirhan. Taibeh is a Christian Arab village,
‘Located about 8 miles northeast of the town of Ramallah. So far as the
Embassy is aware, no fighting on a major scale took place in the Ramallah-
Taibeh area during 19-1946. The period did witness much fighting in other
areas of Palestine, however, including the blowing up of Jerusalem's King
David Hotel in July 196.

1946-1948 Mar Boulos (Saint Paul) Road, near the Saint George School, the
British Commissioner's Building and the radio station. Also

Murara Street and Mamilla Road, Jerusalem, Palestine

Saint Paul's Road and Mamilla Road (EF-3 and DEF-) on the appended map) are
main thoroughfares in the area of Jerusalem west of the Old City and east of
King George Avenue. Murara Street is located in the Mahne Yehuda district
(BC-2, 3). Fighting began between Arabs and Jews in November 1947 and
intensified with the termination of th: British Mandate on May 15, 1948.
Heavy fighting and mugh destruction took place in the vicinity of the radio
station, just west of St. George's School and Saint Paul's Road in 1948.
Many of the houses destroyed in this area have never been rebuilt. Sniping
and terrorist activity took place at the same time in the vicinities of
Murara Street and Mamilla Road.

A chaotic situation prevailed in the Jerusalem area of Palestine in 197-1948.
The massacre of some 250 Arabs, including women and children, in the Jerusalem
suburb of Deir Yassin in April 1948 by the Irgun, a Jewish terrorist
organization, had a profound effect on the Arab community and stimulated

the flight of many Arabs from Jewish-controlled or disputed areas.

198-1957 In a refugee village inside the Old City

During and after the 198 fighting, many Arabs from West Jerusalem took refuge
in the Old City. For the most part they were taken into the homes of friends
and relatives or allowed to live in church buildings rent free. Some may
have slept in caves. There was no ""refugee village"" as such, but many
refugees established themselves in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City where

a large number of buildings had been destroyed during the fighting. Initially,
they lived in tents or temporary shelters built of rubble, until 1954-1955
when more permanent shelters of stone or mud with corrugated roofs were

built. Food was apparently not particularly scarce, but water was rationed
by the Old City authorities during the 1948 fighting owing to the fact tht
Jewish forces had closed off outside water sources and the city had to rely
on internal supplies.

»irhan Trial Receives Close Attention in amman

cae - | Mone trial of the accused assassin of Senator Robert Kennedy, Sirhan Bishara
ono ‘ Sirhan, continues to receive wide press coverage in Jordan. The reporting
3¥ |/0 | - generally is straightforward and detailed. Editorials have been sparse.
NSS fhe following editorial fran the sensationalist Amman weekly
_& Akhbar al-'Usbou' on August ninth, entitled ""Sirhan and the Palestine

Problem"", provides an example of some of the more extreme opinions:

""As a result of the assassination of Senator Robert Kennedy, Sirhan
is standing trial in an American court. His only defense is that
he killed Kennedy for the sake of his country.

""Three important points are raised by this case:

""1, Sirhan is not a criminal, but rather a man of
principle.

""2, The bullet that shot Kennedy was an inevitable
necessity because Zionism has succeeded in attracting bigoted
Christians in America into an unholy alliance by convincing
thom that the Palestine problem is a dispute between Moslems
and Jews, and that it is a Christian duty to support the Jews.
Sirhan Killed <ennedy because he is an Arao first and a
Christian second. He killed kennedy for tne saxe of his nome-
Vand whiten was usurped by the Jews with the help of the Americar.
Living in this atmosphere of direct challenge, Olrhan ciscoverec
the nuceusit, for this bullet.

""Kennedy's assassination has raised many questions in
America, such as: What has this Christian to do with it?
Are the Arab Christians with the Moslems? For whose sake
did Sirhan shoot Kennedy? It is sufficient that Sirhan's
bullet has raised such questions among Americans.

""3, Arabs everywhere have denied responsibility for
this assassination and have avoided comment on the virtues
of political assassination. This attitude of the Arabs
toward Sirhan is similar to the attitude of Pilatus toward
Christ.

""Will Sirhan's trial be able to melt the indifference
and passivity of the Arabs toward this Arab patriot in a
foreign lami?""

Participants: Chief Robert A. Houghton
Los Angeles Police Department

L/NEA - Robert H. Neuman *¢

Subject: Case of Sirhan Bishara Sirhan

"" ,
I spoke with Chief Houghton by telephone this morning
regarding a visit made last night to Sirhan by the Jordanian
Honorary Consul in Los Angeles, Mr. George Zuraykat. Chief
Houghton confirmed that the visit did occur and resulted
from a request made by Sirhan through his attorney, Public
Defender Wilbur Littlefield. During the visit Sirhan and
Zuraykat were required to sit on opposite sides of a glass
partition and to speak to each other through a telephone.
They were further required to converse in English and were
informed that should they attempt to speak in any other
language the phone connection would be terminated. Chief
Houghton said that these conditions were the customary
regulations in the prison in which Sirhan is being held.
Mr. Littlefield sat with Zuraykat during the visit and,
according to Chief Houghton, no prison official was present
in the immediate vicinity where the conversation was
carried on. Chief Houghton added that Mr. Littlefield
had requested that the above described security precautions
be observed during this visit. The Chief also said that
Mr. Littlefield had been permitted to visit Sirhan privately
on several occasions, an exception to the normal prison
regulations, and that no one else, including members of
Sirhan's immediate family, was permitted such private visits.
According to Chief Houghton Mr. Littlefield has requested
that these precautions apply to all persons seeking to visit
Sirhan. The Chief suggested that if we wish to discuss
visits to Sirhan in furtherdetail we contact Mr. Littlefield
directly or the Chief Public Defender, Mr. Richard Buckley.

7? H Consulate General ,Jerusalem
U Embassy,Tel Aviv

The Jordan Ambassador called on me this morning at his request to discuss
the current status of the Sirhan Bishara Sirhan case in California, He was
particularly interested in discussing the implications to Sirhan's trial
should four Jordanian lawyers come to the United States to either assist
the defense of or actually to defend Sirhan in the courts, He said that
he was opposed to the lawyers' coming, as it would interject into the case
a political element, which we have all been endeavoring to avoid, He
mentioned that he had sent a strong message to his Government recommending
that if at all possible the lawyers be dissuaded from coming to the U, 5S,
for the above purpose, Now that the Federation of Lawyers in Amman had
apparently made a decision to do something about the Sirhan case (he
reminded me that the Federation was politically oriented), there was a
limit to how much influence the Jordan Government could exert on the
lawyers because they were now committed to take some action, He mentioned
that he was returning to Jordan for approximately a week in the next few
days and that he would do what he could about the situation. The best
that could be expected, however, would probably be to persuade the Lawyers
or the Federation to finance the hiring of a highly qualified American
lawyer and to nominate one of their own members to the United States to
act as observer during the trial, He was not even sure that this could be
arranged,

I told him that we felt strongly that the Jordanian lawyers should not come
to the U. S. for the very reason that he had offered. We, however, were

to some extent caught on the horns of a dilemma in trying to persuade the
lawyers against coming because we also did not want to open ourselves to
the charge that we were denying Sirhan the right to request a lawyer of

@:; choice, which could include Jordanian lawyers. The Jordan Government
could probably state the concern we both shared more effectively than we
could, We were both interested in insuring that Sirhan received a fair
trial and that no political development enter the picture to prejudice a
fair trial, I told him that I hoped that he could state his case as
strongly as possible in Amman. He said he would,

He asked me when the trial began. After consulting with Mr, Neuman in L,
I informed him by telephone that on June 28 the defendant would have to
plead, i.e,, guilty, not guilty, etc. According to the law, the trial
must begin sixty days after the indictment, which I was informed was
around June 6 or 7. This period could be prolonged by agreement between
the defense and prosecuting attorneys, I told him that the District
Attorney in California ventured the guess that the trial would probably
begin one-and-a-half to two months after June 28,

The Ambassador called me subsequently and said that the Jordan Honorary
Consul George Zuraykat had contacted Sirhan on June 19, He said the
authorities treated the Honorary Consul very well, but the interview
resulted in Little more than the Consul's finding out that Sirhan was in
good health and was being treated well. A satisfactory conversation
between the two was prevented because, according to the Jordan Ambassador,
there was a glass partition between the Honorary Consul and Sirhan and the
Consul had to talk to him by telephone, The Honorary Consul was enjoined

that he had to speak in English or the conversation would be cut. The
Ambassador wondered if this were normal procedure and if it would have
made a difference if a member of his Embassy had tried to talk with Sirhan
rather than the Honorary Consul, I told him I was not certain of what the
law permitted, although I was somewhat surprised by the restrictions
imposed, I told him that I would consult with our Legal Adviser's Office
and would call him back,

4. Should lawyers decide come to US, we would be confronted_”

by a dilemma. On the one hand we fear injection undesirable
political element into case were Jordanian lawyers to defend
Sirhan. Jordanian and Arab cause could suffer badly by over-
zealous efforts of Arab lawyers, however well motivated. On

the other hand, it is within Sirhan's constitutional right

to request lawyer of his choice, which could include Jordanian
lawyers as counsel and consequently would put USG and California
court in awkward situation if refused.

5. In circumstances, there would seem be three courses we

could follow. We could let nature take its course. Alternatively
Embassy could approach appropriate GOJ officials and point out
unfortunate political ramifications which could result if )
Jordanian lawyers were to represent Sirhan. Embassy could
suggest that GOJ attempt in its own interest to dissuade these
lawyers from pursuing their efforts on behalf Sirhan. Finally,

or if lawyers persist, GOJ might attempt to persuade them to

from coming here. Sharaf shares our concern that Arab
lawyers initiative on behalf of Sirhan could inject
unfavorable political aspect into case. Talhouni's
action noted above may have been prompted by Sharaf's

recommendation.

3. Dept also informed that Lebanese (BEIRUT's 10225) and

Libyan lawyers have indicated interest in participation in
Sirhan's defenge. We view these gestures as most probably
publicity stunts.

4. Comment: Talhouni's apparent intervention in matter
appears for the time being to have partially circumscribed
efforts of Jordanian lawyers to inject themselves into
Sirhan case.

Washington
Dear Mr. Secratarys

As attorney who formerly represented Jack Ruby, I see many parallels
between Oswald's assassination of President Kennedy and Sirhan's
assassination of Senator Kennedy.

One of these similarities is the hate and prejudice of Anti-Semitism
that led to each of these outrageous murders, (For a few factual
details see specific references to Anti-Semitism in written Opinion
of Texas Court of Appeals for reversing Ruby conviction and ""Trial of
Jack Ruby"" by Kaplan & Waltz""),

Sirhan is not the only Arab guilty of murder. Guilt is not restricted

to the one who pulled the trigger. Guilt includes all those who. triggered
Sirhan's mind to act and caused him to suffer from irrational impulses, ¥
irresistible pressures and mental disturbances that culminated into an

act of violence. Those Arab mis-leaders like Nasser who poisoned and
polluted Sirhan's mind by filling him with the vicious hate and prejudice
of Anti-Semitism (Anti-Zionism) are no less guilty than Sirhan. ,

‘L

}
u

on var:

Many Arabs like Sirhan have been misled to believe that Israel is their
enemy and the cause of their enslavement and poverty; that the mere ™
existence of an Israel in the Middle East, regardless of its size or Ly
boundaries, prevents Nasser from establishing the entire Middle East into? |
a United Arab Republic that he claims would solve all Arab problems. >
This Nazi-type..of propaganda has led to many irrational acts of violence .
and tragic murders similar to the recent Kennedy assassination.

Not unlike Hitler, these Nassers have exploited and converted a natural
brotherly love and friendship that previously existed between Jews and
Arabs into enmity, hate and murder; contrary to the Golden Era; contrary
to Kind Feisal's letter to Frankfurter and his agreement with Weitzman;

\ contrary to the very teachings of Mohammed and his Holy Koran; and con-

trary to the Arabs own best interests.

The Sirhans were converted 'Christian-Arabs' Living among Moslems in Israe
and constantly subjected to and blinded by Nassar's false vicous propogandé
What could be more confusing and frustrating?

",39,https://www.archives.gov/files/research/rfk/releases/2025/0418/ps_jordan_1_1_67_sirhan_sirhan_biashara_jordan-us_ps_7_1_1_1_67-part_2_of_2.pdf
ps_jordan_1_1_67_sirhan_sirhan_biashara_jordan-us_ps_7_1_1_1_67-part_2_of_2.pdf,18,"Sirhan is so mixed up about his Arab Nationalism that he doesn't even know
nat his ancestors were not Jordanians, Jordan was only recently artificially
ereated after his father was born, Jordan was carved out of the area for

the proposed Re-establishment of the Jewish State,

Sizhan's Anti-Zionism was merely another form of An€i-Semitism. Limited
space here prevents a detailed discussion of Sirhan's political paranoic
Anti-Semitic Anti-Zionism. Suffice to say that the recent re-establishment
of Israel could not be, and is not, responsible for the slavery and poverty
suffered by the Arabs during the last 2000 years. Some Arab States are over
1000 miles away from Israel.

Sixhan didn't stop to realize that Israel (Palestine) was a Jewish state over
3000 years ago and that it was never at any time in all history, an Arab
National Homeland. Nor that there is no ‘conflict of interest' between
Little Israel and the many vast Arab countries. But there are definite
‘conflicts of interest' between the different Arab Leaders and the intrigues
of various Foreign powers competing with eaci. other to exploit, missionize
and dominate the Arabs (vis a vis Russian, Vatican and Oil Barons).

is impossible to compare ""on one foot"" the respective rights and plight
of the hundreds of thousands of Jewish Refugees from Arab countries, as
against the claims of the Fugitives that Sirhan prefers to call ""Arab

Refugees"" except to say that “War is Hell'' and creates problems that only
Peace can solve,

The Sirhans twisted the Arab proverb: ""He who befriends my friend is also
my friend"" into ""He who supports my enemy is also my enemy,'' Therefore,
Nasser-propagandized Arabs believe they must murder every Israeli, or any
American like Senator Kennedy who supported Israel.

if there were no Jews in the United States, it would still,behoove our
Government to support a Democratic state like Israel to het establish
World peace and freedom, and to protect our own American interests in the
Middle East. .

Genocide that has caused the murder of millions of innocent people feeds
on fanatic national and religious hates and prejudices. Therefore, anyone
who teaches or encourages Anti-Semitism (Anti-Zionism), be it nation,
Church, or individual, aided, abetted and are no less guilty than Si: Sixhan
in the ""malicious premeditated murder of United States Senator Robert F.
Kennedy.

Sincerely,
